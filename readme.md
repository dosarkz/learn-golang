## Introduction

Go is an open-source programming language developed by Google. It is designed to be simple, efficient, and reliable. Go is a statically typed language with a syntax similar to C, but with additional features such as garbage collection, type safety, and concurrency support.


## Variables

In Go, variables can be declared using the `var` keyword or the shorthand `:=` syntax.

See more in [Go Variables](go_variables.md).


## Data Types

Go comes with a couple of built-in basic types:

List of basic types: int, float64, string, bool, uint, int32, rune, uint32, int64
